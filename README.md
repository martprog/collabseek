## About
I have a background in music and I know how difficult it may be to be noticed and therefore being able to get a job. This app tries to help in that regard
providing a network of available musicians: each user can navigate through the site but must be logged in in order to interact with other artists.
If the user wishes to appear available for the community, they must create a page artist.

## Features
- Free navigation through the page, but registration needed for interaction
- User can provide and/or update information about themselves
- User can provide new tags, add existing tags to their profile or remove them
- Each accesed profile page show similar artists and links to them
- Star rating system
- Possibilty to add/remove from/to favorites
- Notifications for new incoming messages with every login
